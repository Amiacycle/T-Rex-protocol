# Overview: ERC-3643 & the T-Rex Protocol

ERC-3643 is an identity-based token standard designed to bring real-world assets (RWA) on-chain while ensuring compliance and regulatory compatibility.

The T-Rex Protocol builds on this standard by allowing token issuers to define who can hold or transfer tokens based on verified identities.

## Key Features:
- Identity-driven compliance (KYC/AML)
- Off-chain authorization logic
- Transfer restrictions based on investor eligibility
- Suitable for regulated markets

T-Rex makes tokenized securities and compliant DeFi possible â€” blending real-world trust with blockchain transparency.
